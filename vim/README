After creating a brand new working copy, i.e. cloning this repo and initializing the necessary
submodules (git) as instructed in ../modules.readme, run the following to complete vim setup:
    cd $HOME
    ln -s <repo>/vim/vimrcs/vimrc ~/.vimrc
    ln -s <repo>/vim              ~/.vim
    mkdir -p ~/<repo>/vim/temp_dirs/swp
    mkdir -p ~/<repo>/vim/temp_dirs/bkup
    mkdir -p ~/<repo>/vim/temp_dirs/undodir
    mkdir -p ~/<repo>/vim/temp_dirs/viminfo
There is no need for .gvimrc anymore. It's built-in to .vimrc.
