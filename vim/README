Following directories and their content have been created via perl_vim.zip downloaded
from http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2526. It's version 0.14, released
on 2011.03.22:

    ~/.vim/
           |-- ftplugin            Dir
           |   |-- perl.vim
           |   |-- perl6.vim
           |   `-- xs.vim
           |-- indent              Dir
           |   |-- perl.vim
           |   `-- perl6.vim
           `-- syntax              Dir
               |-- perl.vim
               |-- perl6.vim
               |-- pod.vim
               |-- tt2.vim
               |-- tt2html.vim
               `-- xs.vim

These directories did not exist prior to unzipping of perl_vim.zip.
It does perl & perl6, including MooseX::Declare syntax highlighting.
