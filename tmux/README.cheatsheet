  It is about yanking text spanning more rows than what you see on a tmux window.
  Provide the info back here.

# Provide most commonly used shortcuts and how .tmux.conf is used to change things (Ctrl+w, etc.)
#   http://tmux.sourceforge.net/

Each tmux session is a single 'tmux' process.
You can have as many 'tmux' processes as you want running on the same host.
Within each tmux session, you can have as many tmux windows as you want.

.tmux.conf              # Configuration file, including for key bindings, of tmux.
tmux                    # Create a new tmux session.

The configuration file is read once when starting a new tmux session.
If you make changes to the configuration file, and you want that to take affect on
the currently running tmux session, run on any of its windows: 'tmux source-file <path/file>'.
If the file is in your $HOME, remember to do ~/<filename>.

Sharing your tmux session with other users is possible: http://readystate4.com/2011/01/02/sharing-remote-terminal-session-between-two-users-with-tmux/
If security and trust is not a problem, simply do:
    User1:  machine1> tmux -S /tmp/pair
    User2:  machine1> tmux -S /tmp/pair attach
Now users will have access to the same tmux session. They can create windows, type at the same time, etc.
If a user detaches, and then later attaches back, he will see whatever the other has user has been doing without missing anything.

Ctrl+w                  # Configured it to be the tmux cmd initiation key (I used to use Ctrl+a in 'screen') in the configuration file.
Ctrl+w :                # Start typing a tmux command such as
                        # - 'split-window -v'      to vertically split the current window
                        # - 'move-window -t 12'    to move the current window to number 12
                        # - 'move-window -t right' to move the current window to the tmux session, named 'right' (assuming 2 tmux sessions are running on the same machine, and the other one is named 'right')
                        # - 'source ~/.tmux.conf'  to update current tmux session based on the specified tmux conf file. In this case, it will have the end result of as if a brand new tmux session is started.

Ctrl+w c                # Create a new window in the current tmux session.
Ctrl+w d                # Detach current tmux session.
Ctrl+w ,                # Rename window title to be whatever you type

Ctrl+w Ctrl+w           # Toggle between the current window and the previous one you were on.
Ctrl+w w                # Bring up a list of all windows, use j/k to pick one, and hit enter to switch to that window.
Ctrl+w [Ctrl+]n         # Move to the next window
Ctrl+w [Ctrl+]p         # Move to the prev window
Ctrl+w n                # Go to window n (1, 2, ..., 9, 10)
Ctrl+w Alt+n            # Switch to window 1n.  Ex: 11, 12, .., 19.

Ctrl+w :split-window -v # Split the window (where the cursor is active) vertically
Ctrl+w :split-window -h # Split the window (where the cursor is active) horizontally
Ctrl+w j                # On a vertically split window, move the cursor to the one on top           (like in vim cursor movement)
Ctrl+w k                # On a vertically split window, move the cursor to the one on bottom        (like in vim cursor movement)
Ctrl+w l                # On an horizontally split window, move the cursor to the one on the right  (like in vim cursor movement)
Ctrl+w h                # On an horizontally split window, move the cursor to the one on the left   (like in vim cursor movement)

MouseL <select>         # Copy the selection into the current tmux sessions (available to all its windows) into its own buffer
MouseM                  # Paste what is in the selection

Shift+MouseL <select>   # Copy the selecting into X's copy buffer so you can paste it into other applications' window
Shift+MouseM            # Paste what is in the X's copy buffer so you can get stuff from other applications' window into a window in tmux session.

tmux ls                 # List all tmux session names and their status (attached, detached, etc.)
tmux attach             # Same as 'tmux a'
tmux a                  # Attach to the last detached tmux session. Last means the last time you detached from, not the last on in the list of tmux sessions.
tmux a -t n             # Attach to tmux session number n  (They are numbered 0, 1, etc. List them to see)
                        # You can attach to an already attached tmux session on a different terminal.
                        # If so, all running attachments see what is typed and printed to screen.
                        # Likewise, if a window within the tmux session is changed, all attached sessions repeat the action.

export TERM=xterm       # tmux by default sets TERM to 'screen', and that breaks mouse scrolling and left clicking functionality in vim running on console.
                        # Setting TERM to xterm, complemented by the setup in .vimrc to enable mouse scrolling/left-clicking, fixes the issue with vim running on consoles within tmux.

tmux can be scripted. For instance, the executable bash script 'admin' opens up a new
tmux session, creates and names bunch of windows in it, splits some of the windows vertically
and horizontally, etc.
