# Change the hotkey Ctrl+A to Ctrl+W so that the shortcut Ctrl+A continues

# Remember that Ctrl+A a  also acts as moving the cursor to the beginning

# Hardstatus line is used for status messages from screen - for example to alert you to activity or other similar messages.
# Caption line is usually only shown if there is more than one window open, and allows you to view details of them.

# TODO: Test this (2008.09.05)
# When you check on your download, it's not finished (screen doesn't take that long to download, but we'll
# pretend it does for this demonstration). Time to get back to your messy home directory, right? Before doing
# that, press Ctrl-A Shift-M to monitor the current window for output. Now screen will notify you when there
# is activity in the FTP window. Bouncing between windows to check on your download's progress is no longer
# necessary. This also works in the inverse case; use Ctrl-A _ to monitor for silence (30 seconds by default).
# Monitoring for silence is useful for long compile jobs or other things that spew information.


# Want to go back 3000 lines backwards when scrolling. Default is 100.
defscrollback 3000


# Give me back my scrollback in xterm - Scroll using mouse now works!
# Either of the following works, however, due to hardstatus set to display seconds of the current time,
# the display will show the last page every second. So, take out seconds display if you want to
# be able to use mouse scrolling.
